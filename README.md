## About ##
This is a personal AI project that I made to catagorize different kinds of purchases. It uses Naive Bayes and different scores and reports to give the user different kpis on the dataset that they use.

## NOTE ##
The dataset is VERY SMALL!! Some of the AI predictions will be wrong because of the low accuracy scores that is provided by the small dataset
